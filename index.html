  <h1>Calculator Challenge (abridged)</h1>

	
  <p>
    The goal is to have minimal and complete capabilities for the purpose of directly contrasting programming paradigms against the imperative/structural paradigm.  Adherence to a paradigm will be highly criticized.  The readability and maintainability of your submission is also a direct reflection upon your chosen paradigm.
  </p>
	
  <p>
    Using a sole paradigm of either true OOD (Java) or pure functions (Haskell), write a complete program (include source code) satisfying the following requirements:
  </p>
	
  <ol>
    <li>
	 		<p> Unbreakable, self-contained executable for use within a terminal.  No installation of any kind required to run your program.  Standard library only!
			</p>
    </li>
		
    <li>
			Accept typed input from the user to acquire a mathematical equation for the program to calculate upon the user pressing ENTER.  Must always compute a numerical answer to the user's equation and be mathematical correct[*], or a DNE (Does Not Exist) indicator for a 0-divisor incidence.
			<br> [ *Not concerned about integer overflow and float round-offs.  Just do not break otherwise! ]
    </li>

		<li>  
			On a new line each, repeat accepting inputted equations from the user and computing them upon the user pressing ENTER until the user hits ESC --at any point-- to terminate program.
		</li>

		<li>  
			Capabilities must include many uses (at least four) of each: nested parentheses, divisors ( "/" ), additions ( "+" ), and decimal numbers.
			<br> - Not necessary to handle positive/negative notation from the user's inputs.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Limit user's inputs to forming only equations the program is capable of calculating.
			<br> - Handling of excess opening/closing parentheses or empty parentheses from the user is your choice, not relevant.
			<br> - Also not concerned about use of BACKSPACE from the user.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Program will always be able to continue functioning, no dead-ends.  Only ignore a pre-mature ENTER press (equation calculation) if still requiring/waiting for the user's equation to be properly inputted.  For example: still needing a numerical input to follow an "operator" input ( "/" or "+" ).
		</li>
		
		<li>
			(Skipped for expedition.)
		</li>
	</ol>
