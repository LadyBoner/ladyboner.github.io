    <p>Using a sole paradigm of either true object-oriented design <small>(Java)</small> or pure functions <small>(Haskell)</small>, write a <em>complete</em> program <small>(the source code)</small> satisfying the following:</p>


    <ol>

      <li><p>Unbreakable, self-contained executable for use within a terminal.  No additional installation of any kind required to run your program.  Standard library and system calls only!  <small>(Because those are the boundaries of a language's runtime.)</small></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <small>Compile on at least GNU/Linux.</small>
          </li>
          <li>
            <small>Signal interrupts will be excused.</small>
          </li>
          <li>
            <small>Copyright infringement will be ignored.</small>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>


      <li><p>Accept typed input from the user to acquire a mathematical equation for the program to calculate upon the user pressing <small><strong><kbd>ENTER</kbd></strong></small>.  Must always compute a numerical answer to the user's equation and be mathematically correct<small><sup><strong>*</strong></sup></small>, or a <strong>DNE</strong> <small>(Does Not Exist)</small> or <strong>NaN</strong> <small>(Not a Number)</small> indicator for a zero-divisor incidence.</p>
        <p  class="asterisk">&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><sup><strong>*</strong></sup> Not concerned about integer overflow and float round-offs.  Just do not break otherwise!</small></p></li>


      <li><p>On a new line each, repeat accepting inputted equations from the user and computing them upon the user pressing <small><strong><kbd>ENTER</kbd></strong></small> until the user hits <small><strong><kbd>ESC</kbd></strong></small> <em>at any point</em> to terminate program.</p></li>


      <li><p>Capabilities must include many uses <small>(at least four)</small> of each: nested parentheses, divisors <wbr><small>( <small><strong><kbd>/</kbd></strong></small> )</small><wbr>, additions <wbr><small>( <small><strong><kbd>+</kbd></strong></small> )</small><wbr>, and decimal numbers.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <small>Not necessary to handle positive/negative notation from the user's inputs.</small>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>


      <li><p>Limit user's inputs to forming only equations the program is capable of calculating.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <small>Handling of excess opening/closing parentheses or empty parentheses from the user is your choice, not relevant.</small>
          </li>
          <li>
            <small>Also not concerned about use of <small><strong><kbd>BACKSPACE</kbd></strong></small> from the user.</small>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>


      <li><p>Program will always be able to continue functioning, no dead-ends.  Only ignore a pre-mature <small><strong><kbd>ENTER</kbd></strong></small> press <small>(equation calculation)</small> if still requiring/waiting for the user's equation to be properly inputted.  For example: still needing a numerical input to follow an "operator" input <wbr><small>( <small><strong><kbd>/</kbd></strong></small> <wbr>or<wbr> <small><strong><kbd>+</kbd></strong></small> )</small>.</p></li>


      <li><p><small>(Skipped for expedition.)</small>  &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <small><s>Parse from the command line/shell.  Validate the inputted equation and provide the correct mathematical answer at startup.  Then continue, just the same as done with an interactive user, as described above.  In addition to numerical or DNE answers, this step is allowed to indicate an invalid equation was provided, then continue.</s></small></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <small><s>Ignore <small><strong><kbd>spaces</kbd></strong></small> from the command line/shell.</s></small>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p>Demonstrate scalability.  Implement a reserved feature "the client asks for" after initial submission.</p>

    <summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation Method</summary>


    <p  class="updated"><small><time  datetime="2021-03">2021-03</time></small></p>

    <p>Read carefully. I <em>am</em> going to get you.</p>     

    <p>The OOD and functional submissions will be contrasted to an imperative/structured benchmark of the challenge with best practices written in the C Programming Language, which is specifically <em>not</em> an object-oriented language, and specifically <em>not</em> a functional language.  It is reasonable to expect that the architectures of all the implementations will be contorted to that of its <strong>paradigm</strong>; <em>not be identical logically</em>&mdash;despite language features!</p>

    <p>The submissions will be critiqued on their adherence to their paradigm <em><strong>as they are purveyed</strong></em>.  <small>(Never mind that <em>only now</em> can apologists be found back-tracking on notions!)</small></p>

    <br>

    <h4>OOD vs Structured Best Practices</h4>


    <ul>

      <li>
        <p><em>Can the same logic be implemented in C?</em></p>
        <p><small>A language feature is not a paradigm.  A technique or <i>pattern</i> is not a paradigm.</small></p>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p><em>Is everything oriented as an object?</em></p>
        <p><small>If everything isn't an instantiated object <em>and relevantly so</em>, it would just be equivalent to refer to the structured benchmark as array-oriented or pointer-oriented.  (Nobody says that!)</small></p>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p><em>Can everything be re-used?</em></p>
        <p><small>If an object cannot be instantiated more than once within the same process (without being threaded), then what's the point?</small></p>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p><em>Is everything modelled to real-world objects?</em></p>
      <p><small>Every procedure in programming is a <em>verb</em>.  How are <em>nouns</em> leveraged instead?</small></p>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p><em>Is anything wrapped in a class and instantiated that is just the same logic as a structured implementation?</em></p>
        <p><small>That is redundant.  If it's the whole file, this is just trying to be a module.</small></p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><em>Is it more intuitive to write than a structured implementation?</em></p>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p><em>Is it more modular?  More encapsulated?  More abstracted?</em></p>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p><em>Is there more inheritance?  More polymorphism?</em></p>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p><em>Does it require more comments comparatively?</em></p>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p><em>Is it faster to add new features and scale?</em></p>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <br>



    <h4>Functional vs Structured Best Practices</h4>



    <ul>

      <li>
        <p><em>Can the same logic be implemented in C?</em></p>
        <p><small>A language feature is not a paradigm.  A technique or <i>pattern</i> is not a paradigm.</small></p>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p><em>Is there any state at all?</em></p>
        <p><small>It is too easy to just write most functions without side-effects.  That is why we already have that!</small></p>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p><em>Is there a re-assignment anywhere in the program?</em></p>
        <p><small>That is mutable data.  The <i>const</i> qualifier is already a thing.  (I only know about the term <i>immutable data</i> from functional programmers.)</small></p>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p><em>Does it require more comments comparatively?</em></p>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p><em>Bug found?</em></p>
        <p><small>Debugging is the most costly endeavor and it is far less likely to be necessary if functions cannot have side-effects, and programs do not have state.</small></p></li>

    <p  class="story">The instructor, wearing a hoodie too young for that generation, attests to an intuitive programming paradigm by modeling real-world objects.  A demonstration is given using square, circle, and triangle objects. The mic is dropped, leaving questions on the floor.  I am left to believe that object-oriented design is just syntactic overhead to redundantly instantiate objects.  The assignment is to write a rudimentary console-based <i>conversational</i> server <small>(text responses)</small>.  Do you know where to fit the squares, circles, and triangles?</p>

    <p  class="default">Never mind.  College already has my money; it provided fool's errands.  The instructors didn't even understood header files once outside the realm of <i>importing</i>.  Just that the instructions said to include them.  Nonetheless, when all was said and just beginnning, the graduating class put <i>fullstack developer</i> on their resum&#233;s.  No more than a couple of them are able to decipher the code they copy and paste <small>(license be damned)</small> between merely stringing together APIs within frameworks.</p>

    <p  class="story">Years later these squares, circles and triangles have yet to be a nuisance.  It is all about best practices.  Clear, logical, categorized rational&shy;izations, refined through experience.  <small>(Like the examples you <em>will not</em> find on Rosetta Code.)</small>  Then, word on the street is that there is a new paradigm revolution on the rise.  In a mouse&ndash;infested lair under the city sidewalk, suitable for some teen-aged turtles, among the shrines to <i>doges</i>, an obvious Mr. Robot wanna-be tells of purity using esoteric patterns.  Programs so pure there is no state!</p>

    <p  class="default"><em>Brilliant.</em>  What next: pretend that a single data structure is going to save the world?!  <small>(Sounds like something a douche cult leader wearing a turtle neck would love to take credit for.  All while calling it <i>serverless</i>, even!)</small>  The act of programming is managing state to produce output from input.  Side-effects <em>are</em> the entire purpose!  Your program is effectively a <i>verb</i>, not a <i>noun</i> like an object.</p>

    <p>Next time, I'll be asking you to point to an HTTP API that is <em>not</em> RESTfull already.</p>

    <p  class="digress">I must digress.  This cannot be the same STEM field as that of the women programmers who took the United States into space and beyond Earth.  This amount of fugazi is what one can expect from conservative news media, religious zealots, the nephew executive, and high school english class.  This is the lingo-huxtering of an industry that counts itself as professional, despite lack of accountability.  At any given moment, someone somewhere is doing science or engineering with information technology.  More likely, though, it's siphoning people's private information onto a mis-configured IaaS.  Two households, both <em>not</em> alike in dignity.  With the dream of information infrastructure properly abandoned in favor of self-gratification, it is not a wonder that societal discourse is now driven by emotionally under-developed adults who were stupid enough to be even confused by word problems back in grade school.  Here's an apt <i>social network</i> platform idea you can marquee along with news venues: Shitter.  Because that's where I do most of these interactions already!</p>

    <p>Hey, wanna know how I know this is a white person's industry?  Because they love renaming things and not acknowledging its origin.  <small>(If I have to learn one more name for <i>associative array</i>..)</small>  <em>Plus</em>, scroll past the first couple answers on Stack Overflow and it will became obvious how an accidental pregnancy with one's own cousin is even a thing.  <small>(Some of them will be getting paid to mentor others; like my college instructors.)</small></p>

    <p>What can be realistically expected, though.  These are the people who begin counting using the number zero, all so that they can reference array elements by <i>offsets</i> while still calling them <i>indexes</i>.  Hey, did you know that <i>Cloneable</i> is spelled wrong!</p>

    <p>From now on, I want a chance see the code you wrote <em>before</em> the compiler exposed to you that you are stupid.</p>
