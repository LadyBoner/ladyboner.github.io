  Calculator Challenge (abridged)


The goal is to have minimal and complete capabilities for the purpose of directly comparing other programming paradigms against imperative/structural paradigm.  Adherence to a paradigm will be highly criticized.  The readability and maintainability of your submission is also a direct reflection upon your chosen paradigm.

Using a sole paradigm of either true OOD (Java) or pure functions (Haskell), write a complete program and source code satisfying the following requirements:

1.  Unbreakable self-contained executable for use within a terminal.  No installation of any kind required to run the program.  Standard library only!

2.  Capabilities must include many uses (at least four) of each: nested parentheses, divisors ( "/" ), and additions ( "+" ).

3.  Accept typed input from the user to acquire a mathematical equation for the program to calculate upon the user pressing ENTER.  Each key typed by the user is only accepted if it is contributing to a validly formed equation, resulting in computable inputs only.  Program will only ignore a pre-mature ENTER press (equation calculation) if still requiring/waiting for the user's equation to be properly inputted.  For example: still needing a numerical input to follow an "operator" input ( "/" or "+" ).  Must always compute the correct mathematical answer[*] to the user's equation, or DNE (Does Not Exist) indicator for a 0-divisor incidence.  Not necessary to handle positive/negative notation from the user's inputs.  Handling of excess parentheses (excess opening or empty parentheses) from the user is your choice; not relevant.  Also not concerned about use of BACKSPACE from user.

  [ *Not concerned about integer overflow and float round-offs.  Just do not break otherwise! ]

4.  On a new line each, repeat accepting inputted equations from the user and calculating them until the user hits ESC to terminate program.

5.  (Skipped for expedition.)
